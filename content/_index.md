<div style="text-align: justify;">
Hi, I'm a Computer Science master’s student at the University of Southern California and previously a Software Developer at Oracle. I enjoy working on backend systems, optimization problems, and developer tooling.

Outside of work, I like tinkering with my dotfiles, building small utilities, and exploring ideas around edge computing and ML powered apps. If you’d like to talk about engineering, infrastructure, or cool side projects, feel free to reach out.
